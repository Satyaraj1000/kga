              In 2002, the seeds of Kapol Vidyanidhi International School were
              sown with a profound vision: to cultivate a realm of enlightenment
              through education. With a steadfast commitment to this noble
              cause, the management laid the foundation of the school,
              establishing a stronghold for goodness to flourish. <br />
              <br />
              From its inception, Kapol Vidyanidhi International School emerged
              as a sanctuary for nurturing the holistic development of every
              child – fostering growth not only of the mind, but also of the
              heart and soul.
              <br />
              <br />
              Affiliated to the ICSE curriculum, the school embarked on its
              pioneering journey with a humble cohort of 69 students. Yet,
              fueled by a dedication to academic excellence and holistic
              education, the institution swiftly grew in prominence, earning
              accolades as one of the foremost educational institutions in the
              suburban landscape.
